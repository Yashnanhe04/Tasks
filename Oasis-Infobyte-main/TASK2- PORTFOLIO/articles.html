   <h3> What is Data Analytics?</h3>
By Helen Lee
<p> It is a beautiful article that I came across while browsing. I am attaching a small part of it here. Hope you will enjoy reading.
</p>
<p>
Analyzing data is an integral part of life. People make multiple decisions and come to many conclusions daily using information (data) they have at hand.<br> In the simplest terms, data analytics requires the gathering of information, using a method to organize it, and making a decision based on the output of this process. <br> Whether or not itâ€™s formally referred to as data analysis or data analytics, it happens every day.</p>
<p> At a very broad level, Data Analytics involves making decisions or coming to conclusions based on data that has been systemically organized. <br> A more formal definition would include stages of the Data Analytics process, which include Planning, Collecting, Cleansing, Organizing, and Interpreting/Communicating.<br> A deeper dive into the process will reveal how each state is integral to Data Analytics that produces value.</p>

<p>The Planning Phase is where the Data Analytics project details would be articulated. <br>This includes any specific questions that need to be answered and methodologies that will be used. This phase is essential as it maps the details of the subsequent steps. <br>For example, during the Planning phase, analysts will decide what data sources to use for the project. <br>Not only will data sources be determined, but time periods of analysis as well. <br>In other words, from what time period will data be pulled for use in the analysis? Most importantly, careful planning will ensure that the Data Analytics project is providing value that justifies the costs involved.</p>

<p>The Collecting Phase involves the gathering of the data that will be used in the analysis. <br>This may include data stored internally within an organization, obtained through primary survey research, or gathered from external sources.<br> The data may be quantitative or qualitative. <br> Quantitative data is expressed in numbers as measures or counts, while qualitative data expresses traits or characteristics.<br> The difference between the two is quantitative data defines, while qualitative data describes.</p>
